# Nursing-Assistant-IoT

We are developing an IoT-based Nursing Assistant System that continuously monitors critical patient parameters such as fall detection, heart rate, body temperature, and IV drip blockage. The system uses various sensors integrated with ESP32 microcontrollers, and the collected data is transmitted in real time to a central dashboard or healthcare personnel via alerts.

# Key Features

- Automated Fall Detection using motion sensors for immediate alerts.
- Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring for early detection of abnormalities.
- Body Temperature Monitoring for tracking patient fever or hypothermia.
- Urine Bag Level Detection to prevent overflow and maintain hygiene.
- IV Drip Blockage Detection ensuring uninterrupted medication flow.
- Real-time Alerts & Dashboard for healthcare staff to act promptly.
- Scalable & Wireless System that reduces manual workload and human error.
