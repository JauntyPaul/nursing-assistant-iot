# Nursing-Assistant-IoT

We are developing an IoT-based Nursing Assistant System that continuously monitors critical patient parameters such as fall detection, heart rate, body temperature, IV drip blockage, and urine bag level detection. The system uses various sensors integrated with ESP32 microcontrollers, transmitting data in real-time to a central dashboard.

# Key Features

- Automated Fall Detection  
- Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring  
- Body Temperature Monitoring  
- Urine Bag Level Detection  
- IV Drip Blockage Detection  
- Real-time Alerts & Dashboard  
- Scalable & Wireless System
